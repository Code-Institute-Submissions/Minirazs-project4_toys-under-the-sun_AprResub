# Full Stack Frameworks with Django - Milestone Project: **Toys under the Sun**

[ToysðŸŽ® under the SunðŸŒž](https://toysunderthesun.herokuapp.com/toy/) is an e-commerce website for users to search, review and purchase toys meant for young kids to teenagers globally. It helps to make the users buying experience easy by letting them read and write reviews of these toys before deciding on the purchase. 

The sample user login:

| _ID:_ **happyuser** | _Password:_ Manytoys123 |
| --- | --- |

The administrator login:

| _ID:_ toys | _Password:_ first |
| --- | --- |

## UX

The web application is meant to be easy to manoeuvre for the user or customer to find toys easily, read reviews to determine if it is the right toy for them, add to shopping cart and purchase them. The customer will need to create a user login to either write a review on a toy or make a purchase!

On the other hand, it should also allow the administrator to add, edit and delete toy products from this online catalog. 

## UI

_Colour_

The main colours used in the site are blue, white, and yellow.

_Font_

Cursive fonts that are more playful like Bangers and Caveat to highlight certain key points.

Sans-serif font, Quicksand, which allows easy reading of chunky text.

_Wireframe_

The [wireframe for the home page can be found here.](https://github.com/Minirazs/project4_toys-under-the-sun/blob/master/static/img/wireframe.JPG) The overall idea is to make the web application user-friendly and intuitive to navigate:

1. Navbar on top with all the links related to the products (Toys) and product reviews on the left, and links related to the user and shopping cart on the right.
2. The middle section of the site will show the advanced search criteria and/ or to display the search results or entries.
3. The footer of the site has links similar to the navbar

## User Stories

Users&#39; goals:

1. To find out about the latest toys using the search form (able to search by name, age group suitable to play, country of origin and category)
2. To read reviews of toys and even write / edit reviews
3. To make purchases of toys

Site owners&#39; goals:

1. Earn income from the sale of toys (ecommerce)
2. Increase brand awareness
3. Track customer information â€“ understand the buyers trends to decide what kind of Toy items to bring in and roll out, and capture more sales
4. Authentication and authorisation
  1. to allow new users to sign up, verify their email address etc.
  2. to track purchase / order history
  3. to add/edit/delete product item and information

## Features

- Navbar links to all pages on the site â€“ Toy (Home page), Review and Cart (Shopping cart to lead to checkout)
- Under the Toy / Homepage and after the user searches based on the criteria, upon clicking on the image or name on the card (search display result), it will lead to the individual Toy product page showing its features, price, country of origin, and reviews given by users that have signed up an account.
- Under the Review tab, it shows all the reviews written by user who has signed in. Only the user who has created the review is able to edit and delete it.
- Toy items can be &#39;purchased&#39; by the user by allowing the user to add, remove items from his shopping cart, view the total amount of the purchase, and proceed to the checkout page to enter his credit card details for successful payment.
- Only the Administrator of the site is able to create, edit and delete Toy details. These features are only seen and made available to the Administrator.
- In the Django Admin panel, the administrator is able to view all the Purchase instances (order history of all the users) to keep track of sales and orders.
- In the Django Admin panel, the administrator has the authority to edit user&#39;s details such as password or verify their email addresses.
- In the Django Admin panel, the administrator can also add, edit and delete the Toy and Review.
- Flash messages â€“ to prompt the user on whether certain actions are successfully or unsuccessfully completed. E.g. edited successfully to Cart or deleted successfully
- Footer consists all the links in navbar for user to quickly navigate around the site.
- Mobile responsive â€“ when device and screen size changes, the elements in the site change to optimize the user&#39;s viewing experience.

### _Features that can be improved / Future Developments_

1. Navbar to have a dropdown that leads the user to different Toy categories without needing to use the search form. To make the search form more concise, taking up less space.
2. Have a **banner carousell** right below the navbar to allow users to read what the site is about, the latest trends and ongoing promotions
3. At Product Creation and Editing page, to **dynamically generate additional input fields** and to have **HTML tags to style** the inputs
4. To **create a User app with User model** â€“ for user to access Purchase/ Order history and to enter Shipping details for ordered items to be shipped to him directly.
5. To have **superuser account creation** by having a Superuser app with Superuser model for some toy retailers to list and manage their items, check sales and order details on the site.
6. To have additional pages in the site to describe the T&C of purchases, after sales services and shipment queries etc.

Currently, only the Administrator is able to view Purchase model and instances of every Purchase (Purchase/Order history) in the admin panel.

1. **To have a User account page** â€“ to update particulars, account details like password and email address, shipping address, check Purchase / Order history
2. **Order confirmation** - To send out an email with the purchase details and collection/shipping details to the user with every successful payment order automatically
3. **Successful login user page** â€“ to have a successful login in page and lead user back to User panel (future feature)

_Potential issues or limitations with Product text inputs_

For the text inputs such as description of the toy, product features and review writing, the verification or validation of whether the content typed is correct or no typo errors will be on the Administrator.

A few ways to present the text inputs properly and beautifully will be to allow the Administrator to type in HTML tags in the textarea so that the content can be displayed well. A future feature to be added.

_Issues with User email verification_

**User email verification can only be done at the Django Admin panel, manually clicked verified by the Administrator.** When the user email link was presented in the Gitpod terminal (local server) and clicked to open, no page was found to verify the email.

Also, when app is deployed to Django, the user signing up for a new account. The site says verification email is sent to the user&#39;s email. However, there is no actual email sent despite multiple attempts. In the Django Admin panel under Users, this new user has been registered.


_Issues with Product Editing page and Cloudinary image uploader_

When the administrator edits a Toy item, the Cloudinary image uploader has some issues, causing the form to need to submit twice before the Toy item is successfully updated. Secondly, in the Update Toy page, it is compulsory for an image to be uploaded before it can be submitted even though the existing image URL is still present.

Secondly, as a future development, when the Toy already has an existing image uploaded, the image URL can be stored separately and input so as not needing a new image to be uploaded again.
